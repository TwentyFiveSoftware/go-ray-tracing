# Ray Tracing

## Overview

This is my take on [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io) book.

This project uses the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language, which offers great coding comfort and build-in 
concurrency while maintaining relatively high performance.

The main goal of this project is to be able to compare the performance of Go to C++ and Rust (see below).

## Build & Run this project

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. Clone the repository
3. Optional: Change sample and worker count in `src/main.go`
4. Build the project
   ```sh
   go build -o go-ray-tracing ./cmd/ray_tracing
   ```
5. Run the executable
   ```sh
   ./go-ray-tracing
   ```

## Performance

I've already implemented Peter Shirley's ray tracing in various programming languages running on CPU & GPU and compared their performance.

The performance was measured on the same scene (see image above) with the same amount of objects, the same recursive
depth, the same resolution (1920 x 1080). The measured times are averaged over multiple runs.
